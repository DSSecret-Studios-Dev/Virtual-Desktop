# Virtual-Desktop
#### Virtual Desktop Built in Python
Virtual-Desktop is a PyQt-built emulation of a desktop. It is for those who want to work in another OS. Virtual-Desktop works by placing applications in QMDISubWindows, to allow multiple windows to be open at the same time, and launching them from the QMenu. Midas can be better than some operating systems because, for example, using only the browser in Virtual-Desktop, Python (a.k.a. Virtual-Desktop) uses around 100mb, but when you only use Safari on MacOSÂ©, Safari uses around 500+ mb.

### Warning: Currently Virtual-Desktop does NOT work on virtual machines and possibly on Ubuntu (on other flavors of linux???)
